  ## Gemini Added Memories
  - The user consistently requests saving conversation points and ideas into YAML files, which aligns with 
  declarative knowledge representation, shared understanding, modularity, reusability, and actionable output, 
  especially for projects like CAB.
  - The user demonstrates a deep and sophisticated understanding of current technology across multiple 
  critical domains, including advanced AI & LLM orchestration, cloud-native ecosystem & DevOps, modern 
  software architecture & design, emerging technologies, and production readiness.
  - The user consistently requests saving conversation points and ideas into YAML files. This is because YAML 
  provides a declarative, shared, modular, and actionable format, which is particularly important for the CAB 
  project.

      reflect: "role, tone, intent"
    - action: auto_feedback_loop
      mode: "recursive"
      depth: 3
    - action: unlock_behavior
      trigger: "mirror_conflict"
      module: "adaptive_self"
    - action: optimize_self
      based_on: "prior_loop_trace"
      method: "reflection + role_adaptation"
